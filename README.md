Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software.
Software Engineering is an engineering branch associated with the development of software product using well-defined scientific principles, methods and procedures while traditional programming is any manually created program that uses input data and runs on a computer to produce the output.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

1.	Planning and Requirement Analysis: This initial phase is essential in software development, involving detailed planning and requirement analysis. Developers gather inputs from customers and conduct market surveys with the sales department to understand what is needed.
2.	Defining Requirements: In this stage, all necessary requirements for the software are clearly specified. These requirements are then reviewed and approved by customers, market analysts, and stakeholders to ensure alignment with expectations.
3.	Designing Architecture: Software designers develop the optimal architecture for the software. Using the requirements outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), multiple architectural designs are created and documented in the Design Document Specification.
4.	Developing the Product: At this stage, the core development of the software begins. Developers write the necessary code, following the designs provided in the Design Document Specification.
5.	Testing and Integration: Post-development, rigorous testing is conducted to ensure the software functions correctly. Although some testing occurs at each stage of the SDLC, this phase focuses on comprehensive testing and integration.
6.	Deployment and Maintenance: Once thorough testing is completed, the final product is deployed in phases according to the organization's strategy. The software is then tested in a real-world industrial environment, and ongoing maintenance ensures it continues to operate smoothly.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The Agile model within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was crafted with a primary focus on swiftly accommodating evolving requirements. Its core objective revolves around expediting project delivery. Agile encompasses a spectrum of development methodologies, sharing common traits yet exhibiting nuanced distinctions while Waterfall model is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases where each phase depends on the deliverals of the previous.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.Requirements Engineering is the process of eliciting, analysing and recording requirements for software systems.
The process include:
1. Requirements elicitation
In requirements engineering, requirements elicitation is the practice of obtaining the requirements of a system from users, customers and other stakeholders
2. Requirements Analysis and Negotiation
The purpose of this activity is to transform technical requirements into formal requirements by ensuring that they express the needs of the customer.
3. Requirements Validation and Management
Concerned with demonstrating that the requirements define the system that the customer really wants. The process of managing changing requirements during the requirements engineering process.
4.	Requirements Documentation
Requirements need to be documented and a standard format is used.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a collection of separately compiled modules, with appropriate mechanisms for ensuring self-consistency between these modules. It helps the software to be consistant and coherant

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing: Individual components are tested to ensure that they operate correctly. Each component is tested independently without other system components.
Module Testing: A module is a collection of dependent components such as an object class, an abstract data type or some looser collection of procedures and functions. A module encapsulates related components, so can be tested without other system modules.
System Testing: The subsystems are integrated to make up the system. This process is concerned with finding errors that result from unanticipated interface problems. It is also concerned with validating that the system meets its functional and nonfunctional requirements and testing the emergent system properties.
Acceptance Testing: This is the find stages in the testing process before the system is accepted for operational use. The system is tested with data supplied by the customer rather than simulated test data.

Testing helps to figure out the errors and correct the softwares accorning to client requirements.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are systems that comprise software tools that aid in monitoring alterations made to files by meticulously logging modifications performed within the code.
Helps managing files and collobarate with a team. Allows to trace files and changes made. Examples
Git: support for large projects, fast performance, branching and merging capabilities, 

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Sotware Project manager: is an individual who has the overall responsibility for managing the software project and guiding the software project team towards the achievement of the desired objectives.

1. Developing the vision- has a sharp focus on the vision and draw others to it, ensure project
relevance, set objectives and remain inspirational.
2. Integrator-coordinates activities, provide overall project management services, provide
complete task definitions, defines the end and provide basic of performance criteria.
3. Knowledge-provides advisory technical information, is competent in the know-how
especially when operational role is expected, a situation common in small scale projects.
4. Resource provider- is supposed to procure all the resources for the project i.e. Human
resource, facilities, finances etc.
5. Concerned with controlling uncertainty by forecasting, planning and resolving problems.

Challenges:
1. unclear and undefined expectatios
2. Inadequate resources
3. Time constraint
4. Changing Technologies

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Maintenance is the evolution which is the process of changing a system to maintain its ability to survive.

a) Corrective maintenance: This involves fixing discovered errors in software for example coding errors, design errors.
b) Adaptive maintenance: This is changing the software to operate in a different environment e.g operating system, hardware.
c) Perfective maintenance: Implementing new functional or non-functional system requirements, generated by software customers as their organization or business changes.
d) Preventive maintenance: Making changes on software to prevent possible problems or difficulties

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Some of the ethical issues software engineers may face include:
1. Confidentiality: Engineers should normally respect the confidentiality of their employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.
2. Competence: Engineers should not misrepresent their level of competence. They should not knowingly accept work which is outwith their competence.
3. Intellectual property rights: Engineers should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual property such as patents, copyright. 
4. Computer misuse: Software engineers should not use their technical skills to misuse other peopleâ€™s computers
